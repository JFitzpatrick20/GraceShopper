   <p>
    Welcome to Plants life . This is a website developed to help those interested in plants, trees and shrubs to find the right plants for their home, gardens and workplace. We are interested in botany and will bring facts about plants from basic school level through to more advanced science.
        
    Plants add colour and vibrancy to our environments as well as providing a habitat for many living things that work together to stabilise and optimise the ecosystem. Use our menu above to select specific plant varieties.

<h2>Types of Plants</h2>
<p>There are many types of plants and trees. We aim to separate each into indoor and outdoor varieties as well as breaking don the list by genus and species. For example, bonsai trees are considered indoor plants as well as outdoor plants (depending on the specialist) and (and correctly) fall under the category of tree. The are exotic plants that are great indoors. These include cacti (Cactaceae), types of palm (Arecaceae) and popular carnivorous specialise such as the Venus fly trap (Dionaea muscipula). Incidentally a palm is a flowering plant, not a tree. The name palm tree is derived from the tall nature of many palms and the trunk-like stem, which is actually an unbranched stem developed as the top leaves have been replaced with new leaves above. Read more about Arecaceae in the section of the site dedicated to this wonderful plant.</p>
<h2>Facts About Plants</h2>
<p>There is a section within the Education tab that is related to facts about plants. This section details everything for statistics through to historical uses for some very interesting species. There is also information that relates to the traditional and alternative medical uses for some plants.</p>
<h2>Products to Enhance the Garden</h2>
<p>As well as plants, shrubs and trees, we will provide information about fertilisers and ways to reduce the impact of weeds. We are very driven to only use natural products that have limited harmful effects on the environment. However, we are aware that not everybody shares our philosophy on this and so we will recommend how to use the least amount of potentially harmful chemicals to keep weeds at bay; this is often by supplementing commonly available products with natural alternatives. For example, salt or a solution of vinegar mixed with an ecological washing up liquid may have a similar affect on weeds glowing on a patio or driveway as more synthetic options, but with limited risks to the wildlife and people in the garden.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Plants to People</h2>
<p>Many books have noted that being in nature has a positive effect on human physiology and mental health. For example, we were recently reading a book written by a popular UK doctor that suggested just small periods sat in a garden help to boost mental state and productivity. This, according to the text, also was shown to impact other aspects of health such as people suffering with high blood pressure and obesity. We hope that you will find everything you need to know about the benefits of plants here.
